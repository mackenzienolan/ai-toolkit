```

3. Start dev server:

```

4. Open http://localhost:3000

## Try It Out

Ask about weather in different cities:
- "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
- "How about London?"
- "Tokyo again" (should use cached result!)

## Architecture

- **Agent** - Configured with weather tool and memory
- **Cache** - Weather results cached for 5 minutes
- **Memory** - Conversation context persisted
