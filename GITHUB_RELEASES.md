# GitHub Releases Setup

Your repository is configured to automatically create GitHub Releases when packages are published.

## Two Workflows for Releases

### 1. Changesets Automatic Releases (Enabled)

The [publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml) workflow includes `createGithubReleases: true`, which means:

- ‚úÖ When you merge a release PR, GitHub Releases are **automatically created**
- ‚úÖ One release per package that was published
- ‚úÖ Release notes include the changeset descriptions
- ‚úÖ Tagged with the package version (e.g., `@ai-toolkit/core@1.0.0`)

**No extra work needed!** This happens automatically when you publish via changesets.

### 2. Enhanced Release Workflow (Optional)

The [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow provides more detailed releases:

- Triggered when you create git tags manually
- Includes installation instructions
- Links to npm package page
- Can be customized with additional release assets

**Usage:**
```bash
# Create a tag for a specific package version
git tag @ai-toolkit/core@1.0.0
git push origin @ai-toolkit/core@1.0.0
```

## What Gets Created

When a package is published, you'll see:

### In GitHub Releases:
- **Tag**: `@ai-toolkit/core@1.0.0`
- **Title**: `@ai-toolkit/core@1.0.0`
- **Release Notes**: Changes from the changeset
- **Assets**: None by default (can be added)

### Example Release:

```markdown
# @ai-toolkit/core@1.0.0

## Changes
- Add support for async tools
- Fix handoff context passing
- Update type definitions

## Installation
npm install @ai-toolkit/core@1.0.0

## npm Package
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ai-toolkit/core/v/1.0.0
```

## Viewing Releases

After publishing, view your releases at:
- `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-toolkit/releases`

## Customizing Releases

### Add Release Assets

Edit [publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml) to include build artifacts:

```yaml
- name: Create Release Pull Request or Publish
  id: changesets
  uses: changesets/action@v1
  with:
    publish: pnpm release
    createGithubReleases: true

# Add after the changesets step:
- name: Upload Release Assets
  if: steps.changesets.outputs.published == 'true'
  run: |
    # Your custom asset upload logic here
```

### Customize Release Notes

The release notes come from your changeset descriptions. To improve them:

1. Write detailed changeset descriptions:
   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   # When prompted, write a good summary:
   # "Add support for streaming responses with proper error handling"
   ```

2. Release notes will include these descriptions automatically

### Pre-release Versions

For beta/alpha releases, the workflow automatically marks them as pre-releases:

```bash
# This will be marked as a pre-release
pnpm changeset pre enter beta
pnpm changeset
pnpm version
# Push and merge PR
```

## Monorepo Release Strategy

Since this is a monorepo with multiple packages, you'll get:

- **Separate releases** for each package
- **Independent versioning** per package
- **Individual changelogs** per package

Example after publishing 3 packages:
- `@ai-toolkit/core@1.2.0`
- `@ai-toolkit/cache@1.1.0`
- `@ai-toolkit/guardrails@1.0.1`

Each gets its own GitHub Release!

## Troubleshooting

### Releases Not Created

1. **Check permissions**: Workflow has `contents: write` permission ‚úÖ
2. **Verify GITHUB_TOKEN**: Should be automatically provided ‚úÖ
3. **Check tags**: Releases are created when tags are pushed

### Missing Release Notes

- Release notes come from changeset descriptions
- Make sure you write good descriptions when creating changesets
- To update: Edit the changeset file in `.changeset/` before merging

### Tag Format

Tags follow this format:
- `@ai-toolkit/PACKAGE@VERSION`
- Example: `@ai-toolkit/core@1.0.0`

This allows multiple packages to have independent versions.

## Best Practices

1. **Write good changeset descriptions** - They become your release notes
2. **Use semantic versioning** - major.minor.patch
3. **Keep changelogs updated** - Changesets does this automatically
4. **Test before releasing** - CI runs tests before publishing
5. **Review release PRs** - Double-check versions before merging

## Comparison: npm vs GitHub Releases

| Feature | npm Registry | GitHub Releases |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Package downloads | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Installation | ‚úÖ `npm install` | ‚ùå N/A |
| Version history | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Release notes | ‚ö†Ô∏è README only | ‚úÖ Full notes |
| Source code | ‚ö†Ô∏è Packaged | ‚úÖ Full repo |
| Downloads count | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited |
| Community standard | ‚úÖ Primary | ‚ö†Ô∏è Secondary |

**Both are created automatically!** Users get:
- npm for easy installation
- GitHub Releases for readable notes and source

## Next Steps

Your setup is complete! When you publish:

1. Merge the release PR created by changesets
2. Packages publish to npm ‚úÖ
3. GitHub Releases are created automatically ‚úÖ
4. Users can view releases at your GitHub repo
5. Users can install from npm

No additional configuration needed! üéâ
